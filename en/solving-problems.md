1. # Empathise
 The first step is to consider who you are making the project for. That will the **user** or **users**. Is it yourself? Your friends? A particular group of people, for example, school kids of a certain age, parents, people with a disability or difficulty of some sort?
 
 Whoever your **user** is, the aim of this step is to **gain empathy** for them. That means to put yourself in their shoes and **understand** how they feel. 
 
 Doing your research is an important part of designing anything. You might look around and make **observations** about what your users do and how they do it. Maybe you have read stuff or seen something on TV.
 
  The best way to **empathise** with your user is by asking questions. Get the user to tell you about their experiences with the activity you are interested in. Ask questions such as
 * When was the last time they did the activity?
 * What was their favourite part?
 * What was their least favourite part?
 
 Keep asking "Why?" to get as much detail as you can!
 
 It's ok if you have some ideas already about what they might say, but make sure you ask questions to test whether your **assumptions** are correct!
 
 Find out what's important to them. Don't just focus on facts: look for stories and **feelings**. You are trying to see things from their point of view so you that you can understand **what they need or want**.
 
 {%callout heading="Write it down"%}Make sure you have a pen and paper ready when you are doing your observations. When you're talking to the user, be sure to listen carefully to their answers. Write down lots of notes, keeping track of all the little details. {%endcallout%}



2. # Define
 Once you have gathered plenty of information it's time to sort it out and make sense of it all. The purpose of this step is to take what you have learned and figure out what problem you will be trying to solve with your project.
 
 Grab a highlighter or a different coloured pen and read through your notes, looking for connections and things that jump out at you as important. Underline stuff, circle things, draw connecting lines, and write down a couple of **needs** and **insights**:
 
 ### Needs
 Things that the person needs. There could be just one, or there could be many! What is the user trying to do? Why do they need to do it?
 
 ### Insights
 Extra information you've discovered that might help you when you start coming up with your solution.
 
 Then, **define a problem statement**. Write down specifically what the purpose of your project is. What problem will it solve? Who will you be solving a problem for? This time you are looking for **_your_ point of view**.
 
 {%callout heading="Be specific!"%}This step is all about <b>focus</b>. Your project will be much more useful if you have a clear idea of what you want it to do and why before you start.{%endcallout%}


3. # Ideate
 With a clear problem to solve, you can now get the creative juices flowing and start **brainstorming ideas** for how you could solve the problem. Pens and pencils at the ready... and lots of paper! 
 
 No writing here: sketch out your ideas with **pictures** instead of words. Don't worry about your drawing skills. Since the aim is to describe **ideas** and not create a work of art, stick figures and squiggly lines are perfect!
 
 Come up with as many ideas as you can. Are you planning a website? An app? A game? Maybe you draw a few screens that you have in mind, or some possible layouts of a page. Will there be characters? Buttons? Sounds? Are you designing a robot? What will it look like? What will it do? 
 
 Make sure you put down every idea that pops into your head: you are going for **quantity**, not **quality**. Let your imagination run wild. Who cares if an idea is good or bad? You can think about that later. Right now you just want to get everything out of your head and onto that paper.  
 
 After you have sketched out a bunch of ideas, show them to your user \(maybe that's you!\) to see what they think. Ask them for **feedback**: opinions and suggestions. Maybe they love everything. Maybe they hate it, that's ok too! Ask them what you can change to make it better.
 
 If the user gives you a few suggestions of things to add or change, sketch out a new idea. It could be a couple of changes or even a completely new idea. Then check again to see what the user thinks this time.
  * This process of making changes, getting feedback and going back again to make more changes is called **iterating**. Do as many **iterations** as you need to until you have something you are happy with.
 
 {%callout heading="Remember your goal"%}The user is the person you are making this project for. Don't be upset if they don't like something. Getting their feedback is your chance to learn more about their feelings and motivations. All feedback is good feedback because it helps you to come up with the best possible solution. {%endcallout%}

4. # Prototype
 This is the part where you actually make something! 
 
 Based on the ideas you came up with and the **feedback** you got, create the first **prototype** of your project.
  * A **prototype** is an early version that is made for testing out an idea
 
 This is not a finished solution! It doesn't even have to be half of a solution. Start small. For example, if you are making a game, you might just do one screen that does one little thing. If you are making a robot, maybe you build a mini version of it with paper and straws, to get an idea of what it will look like in real life.
 
 {%callout heading="The prototype is not the end"%}You don't have to make the whole project at this stage. You might only make one tiny part of it or a simple example for now. You just need to do enough to test it out and see if you are on the right track. You will make plenty more prototypes as you <b>iterate</b> through the process. {%endcallout%}


5. # Test
 Once you have a working prototype, get a user to **try it out**, or try it yourself. 
 
 Once again, the aim is to get **feedback**. Are you on the right track with the project? Is it doing what it is supposed to do? So far maybe it only does a part of it's job, in that case does it do that correctly? Does it look how you want it to look? 
 
 Is the person using your creation the way you expected them to? If not, why not? What can you change?
 
 Just like when you were sketching out ideas, all feedback is good feedback. That's the purpose of **prototyping**. It would be an awful shame if you spent a lot of time developing a whole project and found out after you were done that it wasn't right. By doing lots of small **iterations**, you build your project bit by bit, testing it as you go along. That way you find out early on if you need to change something.
 
 {%callout heading="Iterate!"%}Keep making new prototypes and testing them out. Do a small chunk of work each time, for example add a new screen or button, work on a bit of movement or sound, whatever makes up your project. Gradually you will build up all the pieces and end up with a finished product. Test out the finished product too! Keep making changes and testing again until you and your user are satisfied. {%endcallout%}
