1. # Empathise
 The first step is to consider who you are making the project for. That will the **user** or **users**. Is it yourself? Your friends? A particular group of people, for example, school kids of a certain age, parents, people with a disability or difficulty of some sort?
 
 Whoever your **user** is, the aim of this step is to **gain empathy** for them. That means to put yourself in their shoes and **understand** how they feel. 
 
 Doing your research is an important part of designing anything. You might look around and make **observations** about what your users do and how they do it. Maybe you have read stuff or seen something on TV.
 
  The best way to **empathise** with your user is by asking questions. Get the user to tell you about their experiences with the activity you are interested in. Ask questions such as
 * When was the last time they did the activity?
 * What was their favourite part?
 * What was their least favourite part?
 
 Keep asking "Why?" to get as much detail as you can!
 
 It's ok if you have some ideas already about what they might say, but make sure you ask questions to test whether your **assumptions** are correct!
 
 Find out what's important to them. Don't just focus on facts: look for stories and **feelings**. You are trying to see things from their point of view so you that you can understand **what they need or want**.
 
 {%callout heading="Write it down"%}Make sure you have a pen and paper ready when you are doing your observations. When you're talking to the user, be sure to listen carefully to their answers. Write down lots of notes, keeping track of all the little details. {%endcallout%}



2. # Define
 Once you have gathered plenty of information it's time to sort it out and make sense of it all. The purpose of this step is to take what you have learned and figure out what problem you will be trying to solve with your project.
 
 Grab a highlighter or a different coloured pen and read through your notes, looking for connections and things that jump out at you as important. Underline stuff, circle things, draw connecting lines, and write down a couple of **needs** and **insights**:
 
 ### Needs
 Things that the person needs. There could be just one, or there could be many! What is the user trying to do? Why do they need to do it?
 
 ### Insights
 Extra information you've discovered that might help you when you start coming up with your solution.
 
 Then, **define a problem statement**. Write down specifically what the purpose of your project is. What problem will it solve? Who will you be solving a problem for? This time you are looking for **_your_ point of view**.
 
 {%callout heading="Be precise"%}This step is all about <b>focus</b>. Your project will be much more useful if you have a clear idea of what you want it to do and why before you start!{%endcallout%}
