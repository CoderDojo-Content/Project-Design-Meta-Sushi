1. # Empathise
 The first step is to consider who you are making the project for. That will the **user** or **users**. Is it yourself? Your friends? A particular group of people, for example, school kids of a certain age, parents, people with a disability or difficulty of some sort?
 
 Whoever your **user** is, the aim of this step is to **gain empathy** for them. That means to put yourself in their shoes and **understand** how they feel. The best way to do this is by asking questions.
 
 Get the user to tell you about their experiences with the activity you are interested in. Ask questions such as
 * When was the last time they did the activity?
 * What was their favourite part?
 * What was their least favourite part?
 
 Dig deeper by asking "Why?" often.
 
 It's ok if you have some ideas already about what they might say, but make sure you ask questions to test whether your **assumptions** are correct!
 
 Find out what's important to them. Don't just focus on facts: look for stories and **feelings**. You are trying to see things from their point of view so you that you can understand **what they need or want**.
 
 {%callout heading="Write it down"%}Make sure you have a pen and paper ready when you talk to your user. Write down lots of notes, keeping track of all the little details. {%endcallout%}



2. # Define
 Once you have had a nice chat with your user it's time to take all the information you gathered and try to sort it into something useful. Read through your notes and look for these two key things:
 
 ### Needs
 Things that the person needs. What are they trying to do? Why do they need to do it?
 
 ### Insights
 Extra information you've discovered that might help you when you start coming up with your solution.
