1. You've decided that you want to do a project. Yay! That's exciting. 

 But just how do you get started? It can seem like a daunting task, but don't worry, you've got this. The trick is to break it up into little pieces and start small. 

 For example, when someone builds a house, they might first decide what kind of house to build, then draw up plans for what it should look like, then based on the plans work out how they will build it, and finally gather the materials (and maybe builders!) needed and do the building work.
 
 These cards will take you through the process of designing and building your technology project from start to finish. 

2. There are five main steps that you carry out:
 * **Pick a problem**

 How do you want to change the world with technology? Look up how other people have solved similar issues.
    
 * **Who are you helping?**
 
 Think about what kinds of people your project will help and how it will work best for them. How can you adapt it to their needs?

 * **Generate ideas**
 
 Collect ideas, no matter how wacky, for how your project might work. Pick your favourite!

 * **Design and build**
 
 Draw some designs for the idea you picked, then start making it! Remember your Dojo's Mentors can help if you have trouble.
 
 * **Test and tweak**
 
 As soon as some of the project works, get people to try it! Ask them how to make it better or more useful. Tweak it and test it again.

 This is an **iterative** process. That means you repeat parts of it, maybe lots of times, before you are finished.
